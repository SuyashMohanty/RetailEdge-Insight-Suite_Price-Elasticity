## Key Components and Insights:

### Segment-wise Price Elasticity:
- **Demand Curves**: Visualize the relationship between price and demand for each segment.
- **Elasticity Values**: Quantify the sensitivity of demand to price changes. A more negative value indicates greater elasticity (demand is more sensitive to price).
- **Insights**: Diamond and Platinum segments appear to be more price-sensitive than Gold and Silver, suggesting that pricing strategies for these segments should be carefully considered.

### Promotional Impact on Price Elasticity:
- **Comparison of Elasticity**: Compare price elasticity with and without promotions.
- **Insights**: Promotions can potentially increase or decrease price elasticity, depending on the segment and product. Analyzing these trends can help optimize promotional strategies.

### Competitor Analysis:
- **Cross-Price Elasticity**: Measure the impact of competitor price changes on demand for your products.
- **Insights**: Understanding how competitor pricing affects your sales can help you adjust your own pricing strategy to maintain market share.

Overall, this dashboard provides a valuable tool for pricing decision-making by offering insights into consumer behavior, competitive dynamics, and the effectiveness of promotional activities.
